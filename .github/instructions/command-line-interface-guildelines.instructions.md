## Foreword
In the 1980s, if you wanted a personal computer to do something for you, you needed to know what to type when confronted with `C:\>` or `~$`. Help came in the form of thick, spiral-bound manuals. Error messages were opaque. There was no Stack Overflow to save you. But if you were lucky enough to have internet access, you could get help from Usenet—an early internet community filled with other people who were just as frustrated as you were. They could either help you solve your problem, or at least provide moral support and camaraderie.

Forty years later, computers have become so much more accessible...

## Introduction
This document covers both high-level design philosophy, and concrete guidelines. It’s heavier on the guidelines because our philosophy as practitioners is not to philosophize too much. We believe in learning by example, so we’ve provided plenty of those.

## Philosophy

### Human-first design
Traditionally, UNIX commands were written under the assumption they were going to be used primarily by other programs...  

### Simple parts that work together
A core tenet of the original UNIX philosophy is the idea that small, simple programs with clean interfaces can be combined...  

### Consistency across programs
The terminal’s conventions are hardwired into our fingers...  

### Saying (just) enough
A command is saying too little when it hangs for several minutes...  

### Ease of discovery
It is assumed that command-line interfaces are the opposite of GUIs—that you have to remember everything...  

### Conversation as the norm
Running a program usually involves more than one invocation...  

### Robustness
Software should be robust, of course: unexpected input should be handled gracefully...  

### Empathy
Command-line tools are a programmer’s creative toolkit, so they should be enjoyable to use...  

### Chaos
The world of the terminal is a mess. Inconsistencies are everywhere...

## Guidelines

This is a collection of specific things you can do to make your command-line program better.  

### The Basics
- Use a command-line argument parsing library where you can.  
- Return zero exit code on success, non-zero on failure.  
- Send output to stdout.  
- Send messaging to stderr.  

### Help
- Display extensive help text when asked (`-h` or `--help`).  
- Show concise help text when run with no arguments.  
- Provide examples first.  
- Suggest corrections when the user mistypes.  
- Provide support paths (GitHub, website).  
- Format help text clearly.  

### Documentation
Help is brief; documentation is full detail...  

### Output
- Human-readable first, machine-readable second.  
- Support `--plain` and `--json`.  
- Display output on success, but keep it brief.  
- If you change state, tell the user.  
- Use color and symbols sparingly and intentionally.  

### Errors
- Catch errors and rewrite them for humans.  
- Group similar errors.  
- Provide bug report paths.  

### Arguments and flags
- Prefer flags over arguments.  
- Always support `--help` and long forms.  
- Use standard names for flags (`-h, --help`, `-v`, `--json`).  
- Confirm before dangerous operations.  

### Interactivity
- Prompt only if stdin is a TTY.  
- Support `--no-input`.  
- Don’t echo passwords.  
- Let the user escape (`Ctrl-C`).  

### Subcommands
- Use subcommands for complex tools.  
- Be consistent across subcommands.  
- Avoid ambiguous names.  

### Robustness
- Validate user input.  
- Print something in <100ms.  
- Show progress bars for long operations.  
- Handle failures recoverably.  

### Future-proofing
- Keep interfaces stable.  
- Warn before breaking changes.  
- Encourage explicit use of `--plain` or `--json` in scripts.  

### Signals and control characters
- Handle `Ctrl-C` gracefully.  
- Exit quickly on interrupts.  

### Configuration
- Use flags for per-invocation config.  
- Use env vars for per-session config.  
- Use files for project-level config.  
- Follow XDG spec.  

### Environment variables
- Stick to uppercase, underscores.  
- Don’t read secrets from env vars.  

### Naming
- Short, lowercase, memorable.  
- Avoid collisions with common commands.  

### Distribution
- Prefer single binaries.  
- Make uninstallation easy.  

### Analytics
- Don’t collect data without consent.  
- Opt-in is best; opt-out requires transparency.
